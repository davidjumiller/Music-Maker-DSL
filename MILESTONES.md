Use this file to commit information clearly documenting your milestones'
content. If you want to store more information/details besides what's required
for the milestones that's fine too. Make sure that your TA has had a chance to
sign off on your milestones each week (before the deadline); typically you
should discuss your material with them before finalizing it here.

# Milestone 1

## The Idea
Music Maker - Ability to generate a basic musical tune based on a specification.

<ul>
  
  <li>String together different sounds</li>
  <li>Tracks that can loop, and layer on top of each other</li>
  <li>Would need some sort of soundbyte upload system? Gui?</li>
  <li>Alternatively, we can have the ability to create sounds with the DSL, ex: change pitch, tone, speed, volume. Which then come together to make some kind of music or sound effect.</li>
  
</ul>

## Things to do

<ul>
  
  <li>Deliberate and design a structure for the DSL</li>
  <li>Research and finalize technical implementation details for interpreting the DSL (use of frameworks, method of input for the DSL, etc.)</li>
  <li>Division of responsibilities</li>
  <li>Identify potential users to document user stories</li>
  
</ul>
